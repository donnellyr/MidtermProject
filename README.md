## Description
In these trying times post pandemic we realize that families are going to have a difficult time making ends meet with the economy in a nosedive and rising inflation. We recognize that there is a need for a community-based bartering system and their families when they are not able to go to the store and buy brand new clothes might benefit from a site where they could trade other things they don’t need for those needed goods. Children’s clothes in particular are one item that don’t get a lot of use before a family needs to buy the next size up therefore we would like to offer our communities an opportunity to swap the goods that they have and don’t need for goods that they do need. This site will allow users to login, post the goods that they would like to trade browse goods posted by others, set up meetings at safe locations such as fire houses and police stations and give our communities The opportunity to share during these tough times.

## Team Challenges and What We Learned
#### Steph
This group project was an example of how a group can work together and come up with a great product. I learned a lot about working in a group setting. We all kept our ideas of the website fluid so that compromise was possible. This project was a more in-depth version of CRUD then previous projects. Using multiple controllers, multiple DOA‘s and multiple JSP‘s all working together was interesting. We had a couple of merge conflicts throughout the process but for the most part we communicated very well and made sure that nobody was working on the same piece of the project at any time. To only have one or two merge conflicts in a weeks long project was impressive. There are multiple aspects of CRUD for each entity. The introduction of one to many, many to one and many to many from the database is fairly new concept. Seeing how the many to many relationships work in the methods was great as we had several.

#### Ryan
- Learned how to use Many to many mappings in the creation and editing of data base objects
- Had to figure out how to have certain features available to some users but not others, this was accomplished by using if logic that would present      certain features and information to users based on thier user ID
- Gained an increased understanding of bootsrap to make the front end more visually appealing 

#### Lawrence
- Gained a lot experience on my understanding and implementation of entity relationship mapping
- Realized that sometimes JSP logic is easier to implement than in Java
- Increased my JSP EL usage and complexity
- Used bootstrap and CSS much more for this project
- Swarming and pair programming is much more effective when used properly
