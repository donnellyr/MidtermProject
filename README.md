## Description
In these trying times post pandemic we realize that families are going to have a difficult time making ends meet with the economy in a nosedive and rising inflation. We recognize that there is a need for a community-based bartering system and their families when they are not able to go to the store and buy brand new clothes might benefit from a site where they could trade other things they don’t need for those needed goods. Children’s clothes in particular are one item that don’t get a lot of use before a family needs to buy the next size up therefore we would like to offer our communities an opportunity to swap the goods that they have and don’t need for goods that they do need. This site will allow users to login, post the goods that they would like to trade browse goods posted by others, set up meetings at safe locations such as fire houses and police stations and give our communities The opportunity to share during these tough times.
